# Demostriation of implementing Java Data Structures 

* Class SimpleNode is the superclass used to implement different data structure
* SimpleNode provided basic attributes: content, predecessor and successor and designed as an container to fit any data types
* Each data structure inherited SimpleNode for its own implementation by overriding

##  Four essential components for Object oriented programming (OOP) in Java
* Encapsulation shown in class SimpleNode
  * All three attributes are set private --> can only access and modify via public functions
* Polymorphism shown in class SimpleNode
  * Function to set attributes and constructors were implemented with or without input for different purpose
  * Function to set attributes without input --> clear attributes to null value
* Inheritance shown in class for each data structure
  * Example: Doubly linked list extends SimpleNode
* Abstraction (TODO: Convert class SimpleNode to abstract class Node and implemented in class SimpleNode)
